## Overview

The Mosaic Bot is a Raspberry Pi-based project that employs the LA5D robotic arm to automate the sorting of mosaic pieces according to their shape and color. Utilizing Python and OpenCV for image processing, the bot captures images of the pieces and analyzes their characteristics in real-time. This enables precise categorization, allowing the robotic arm to efficiently sort the mosaic pieces into designated bins. 

## Main features
- **Automated Sorting:** Utilizes the LA5D robotic arm to automatically sort mosaic pieces based on their shape and color, significantly reducing manual effort.

- **Real-time Image Processing:** Employs OpenCV to analyze images of mosaic pieces in real-time, allowing for immediate categorization.
